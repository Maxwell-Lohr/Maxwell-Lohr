<p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: helvetica;"> Originally from Costa Mesa, CA, I'm a digital media designer who specializes in image manipulation, magazine layouts, and typography. Much of my style and creative direction is a result of my up bringing in southern Californian surf culture. </p>

<p style="color: white;  text-align: left; font-family: helvetica;">The goal of this project was to use a reduced vector image to display an emotion or message using a limited color palette and a specific set of text. The image I used was a pair of glasses and the word perspective came organically after further exploration. The text I used was a quote from an interview with singer and speaker Henry Rollins of Black Flag. His statement on cultural relativism and historical nostalgia works synergistically with the image.  </p>

<p style="color: white; text-align: left; font-family: helvetica;">The main mission of the book redesign was to give a more modern and forward look to the classic tale. I took inspiration with the culture of my Hometown of Costa Mesa and the thriving tattoo art that my friends would constantly draw when we were growing up. This, along the vintage style of cheap images used in news print, a vision of striking colors, vivid imagery, and the triadic color scheme of red, black, and white emerged. The Majority of the fonts used in the book are Bodoni 72 normal weight with a mix of Bodoni 72 Small Caps.  </p>

<p style="color: white; text-align: left; font-family: helvetica;"> Blue Clay is a Zine / Magazine that I started producing in effort to shine light on the lesser known figure that are pivotal to the surf industry and the culture at large.   </p>
